# Weapon-Detection

## Overview
This project implements a weapon detection system using Python, Jupyter Notebook, and the YOLO (You Only Look Once) model. The primary focus is on detecting guns within images, leveraging advanced Digital Image Processing techniques.

## Features
- *Object Detection*: Utilizes the YOLO model for real-time object detection.
   • Assisted police in identifying dangerous situations by detecting guns in images.
- *Weapon Identification*: Specifically trained to detect guns in various images.
   • Implemented a pre-trained model on a custom dataset specifically created for detecting weapons.
- *Digital Image Processing*: Applies advanced techniques to enhance detection accuracy and performance.
   • Enhanced security by using computer vision and deep learning to identify weapons in images and video streams.
